luudum dare 45 - frost and fire - based on the bradbury story

day/night cycle - day fries you, night freezes you. you can survive only for a short time from dusk to nightfall
the green grows and burns away in the interval
you are in a cave system with the tribe

you and every person die every minute and are reborn

there are the remains of a ship at the entrance
there is an escape shuttle a few miles away, no one has mapped the way, it is a legend
you can survive in caves
memory modules from others can reveal the map
you drop one when you die as well

ride the brief rivers for a speed boost but don't miss your exit

gain a piece of equipment when you reach the ship.

carve new rivers with the ship's laser

get 20 people to the ship to escape (lemmings style) using ships equipment

-DEFENSIVE TOWER DEFENSE

path starts out very long

use the ship's beam to optimize the path length (1 charge every 20 sec or smth, generates one square of easy terrain)

zones: lava, intense rads, frost, easy terrain, hard terrain, normal terrain, blocking terrain

the path gets modified by random events (avalanche, creates squares of difficult or blocking terrain, coming of day generates random lava squares, night brings frost squares)

place various kinds of healing towers to keep your people alive as they navigate the path
	-healing tower restores health to one target, lowering speed (upgrade: amount, speed, range)
	-youth tower grants unit gradually increasing movement speed
	-rad tower prevents rad damage and/or ageing in radius (upgrade: reduction amount, radius)
	-healing field restores health to nearby targets (upgrade: radius, frequency, amount)
	-innoculation tower grants health regen to targets nearby (upgrade: regen rate)
	-modification tower grants resistance to one damage type and vulnerability to another
	-resurrection tower, periodically bring back a dead unit in radius
		
radiation intesifies each round, and the ground damage type shift from frost to fire (lava is 5am-11pm / frost is 11pm-5am)
random events increase in frequency
different damage types: frost/fire
different people types: child/old/young - health/speed trade off - child is low health high speed - young is balanced - old is low on both
the people age as they walk unless protected in some way

knowledge resource generated when someone gets through to the ship (optimize a tower, place a new type, etc)
win if you save enough people to man the ship and gain enough knowledge


ship crew member unlocks / abilties:
trigger colonist wave (default, best weather between 5-6am and 12-1am)
laser drill (default, make 1 block passable, change 1 frost block to normal, or a normal block to lava)
cryo launcher (default, change 1 passable block into an impassible frost block, or change 1 lava block to a normal block)
+more reactor charges can be stored (ship's reactor charges starts max 2 per round (1 emrg overcharge allowed), +1 per 5 crew rescued)
stretch goals:
--healing drone, targets lowest health unit with a moderate heal (default, upgrades on speed, radius, range available per 5 crew)
--grav drone, floats colonists slowly over damaging tiles in radius (20 crew rescued)

colonists always take the shortest path, and run screaming if there is no path

round changes:
    lava flow: a plus shape of tiles becomes lava
    glacial freeze: a plus shape of tiles becomes frost
    avalanche: one random tile becomes impassible
    entrance may also move, or a new entrance added

tile types:
    lava/frost/normal
    passable/impassible
    cave entrance/ship exit


playtest damage zone density curve increase per day cycle
music / font
mute button
possibly add cleaning drone
